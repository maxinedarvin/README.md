# 👋 Hi, I'm Max.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **BS Mathematics** graduate from the University of the Philippines Diliman with a passion for **Data Analytics** and **Actuarial Science**. I like working on projects that give data-based solutions for practicality and efficiency.

_WORK EXPERIENCE_
* 💼 I currently work as an Actuarial Valuation Analyst for Willis Towers Watson Philippines. I use data for actuarial funding valuations of pension plans offered by companies in Canada.
* 📊 I am currently the External Affairs and Finance Committee Co-Director of the UP Data Science Society, and primarily manage organization finances as well as leadership responsibilities for data science collaborations.

_RESEARCH EXPERIENCE_
* 📚 Poster Presenter, [1st International Workshop on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science](https://www.facebook.com/IMathUPD/posts/2025-international-workshop-on-computational-and-mathematical-methods-in-data-sc/1161514155982439/).
* 🗣️ Oral Presenter, [2025 Mathematical Society of the Philippines Annual Convention](https://www.mathsociety.ph/).
* 🎤 Invited Speaker, [ROADWISE: The Road Safety Systems Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/p/RoadWise-Safe-Systems-Challenge-Philippines-61576205827063/).

_PERSONAL PROJECTS_
* 🚲 I was the Lead Proponent of Team Cycling Maroons in the 2024 Philippine Junior Data Science Challenge, which used optimal location finding for smart bicycle stations using student population density estimates.
* 💻 I was a freelance coder for Team Quasar, who later won in Maya's Big 3 Startup Showdown event last April 2025. I cleaned data and trained multiple machine learning models on 2500+ entries of real-life demographic data provided by a local Philippine bank to predict cashflow data and credit score of banking customers.
