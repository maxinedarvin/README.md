# 👋 Hi, I'm Max.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a BS Mathematics graduate with a passion for **Data Analytics** and **Actuarial Science**. I like building machine learning algorithms for projects that give data-based solutions for practicality and efficiency.

_WORK & CONVENTION EXPERIENCE_
* 📊 I currently work as an Actuarial Valuation Analyst for Willis Towers Watson Philippines.
* 📚 Poster Presenter, 1st International Workshop on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science (CoMaDS)
* 🎤 Oral Presenter, the 2025 Mathematical Society of the Philippines Annual Convention

_SOME (but not all!) OF MY PROJECTS_
* 🚲 I was the Lead Proponent of the Cycling Maroons team in the 2024 Philippine Junior Data Science Challenge, which used optimal location finding for smart bicycle stations using student population density estimates.
